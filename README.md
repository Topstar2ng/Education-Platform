# Education-Platform
The Education Technology Platform will be a secure, cloud-based system designed to help educational institutions manage student data efficiently. The platform will focus on encrypted storage, access control, and anomaly detection to ensure data security and integrity.

# Modules
To keep the project organized and scalable, I propose breaking it into the following modules:

User Authentication and Access Control Module

Handles user registration, login, and role-based access control (admin, teacher, student).

Ensures secure authentication using password hashing and session management.

## Student Data Management Module

Allows admins and teachers to add, update, delete, and view student records.

Stores student data (e.g., name, ID, class, grades) in an encrypted format.

## Coursework Management Module

Enables teachers to upload coursework (e.g., assignments, exams) for students.

Students can view and download their coursework securely.

## Anomaly Detection Module

Monitors user activity (e.g., login attempts, access to sensitive data).

Alerts administrators of suspicious behavior (e.g., multiple failed login attempts, unauthorized access attempts).

## Dashboard Module

Provides a user-friendly interface for admins, teachers, and students to interact with the platform.

Displays relevant data based on the user's role.

## Database Module

Manages the MySQL database schema and connections.

Ensures data is stored securely and efficiently.

## Technology Stack
Frontend: HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, jQuery for a responsive and interactive user interface.

Backend: Python (Flask or Django) for server-side logic and API development.

Database: MySQL for storing student records, coursework, and user data.

Security: Password hashing (e.g., bcrypt), encryption (e.g., AES), and session management for secure access.
